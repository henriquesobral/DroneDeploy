This [zip file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/drone.deploy.map.engine/example.zip) contains 24 images of a massive rock near the beautiful Goat Rock Beach in Sonoma, CA. These images can be used to create a 3D reconstruction of the rock which looks like [this](https://sketchfab.com/models/58a312fb79b94867812ecd1f42cd053f).

We would like you to code the first stage of this reconstruction which involves placing the images correctly to create a mosaic. Use the information below about the locations of the cameras to draw all these images in the correct location on the plane. For example:

The camera used to take these images had a 35mm focal length of 2 0.  

The follow gives the locations and pose of each image in the zip file:
